Primeiro tempos que definir o que é um robô. 

Industrial Robot:A mechanical device that can be programmed to perform a varietyof tasks of manipulation and locomotion under automatic control.

In artificial intelligence, an Intelligent Agent (IA) is an autonomous entity that observes through sensors and acts upon an environment using actuators (i.e., it is an agent) and directs its activity towards achieving goals (i.e., it is "rational", as defined in economics). Intelligent agents may also learn or use knowledge to achieve their goals. They may be very simple or very complex: a reflex machine such as a thermostat is an intelligent agent.
